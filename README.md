# My-Weather-Website
It's a weather website, developed using openweathermap.org API. It shows the current weather data of any city all around the globe and the data of next week's weather(next seven days). Also one can see current AQI of any city(only if its population is greater than 5 lakh). This website is my first experience with APIs, so there's more to come soon.
